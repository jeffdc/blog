I wish I could say that I boldly decided to abandon the previous 10 years of my spotty blogging life and make a clean-break, but instead it is simply that I did not properly respect the power of [rsync](http://everythinglinux.org/rsync/). Let me just say, thank goodness for backups! Losing the entire www directory on my hosted account made me think about whether I even wanted to carry all of that baggage forward. I have decided for the clean break. Now I can look forward to 10 more years of writing stupid banalities before I rsync my way to a reset again.
