I recently setup my [profile](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jeffclark) on [stackoverflow Careers 2.0](http://careers.stackoverflow.com) site. I really like what they have done with the site. I also love the idea that I can put myself out for employers to see without having to use the monstrosities that Monster, Dice, et al are. This should at the very least cut down on all the annoying recruiter emails/calls that I still get (after last having my resume on Monster/Dice nearly 3 years ago!). I highly recommend checking them out.
