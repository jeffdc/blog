I have been on and off (mostly off) blogging at this domain for nearly 10 years. I have been through many blogging platforms. I have hosted the site here in my house over a DSL connection on an AMD 900mhz server that I built, I did finally move to an actual web host and do not miss the whirr of all those fans and hard drives. Each time I have begun blogging again I have abandoned it. I think that this abandonment is due to a mix of talking to a vacuum and dealing with blogging platform friction.

Bringing me to the present day and my next attempt and next [platform](http://www.octopress.org). I am still puzzling through what, exactly, the theme is going to be. I have spent the last 15 years creating software, the last 3 being a stay-at-home dad, and the last 18 months working on an [app](http://www.behaviorsforlife.com) for the iOS platform. I promise I will not be creating a stay-at-home dad "mommy blog". Thus I am pretty sure that I will be blogging about programming and maybe eve some partially-informed technology punditry. 

One more thing. My previous blogging efforts were mostly centered around what I call Angry Citizen. Basically I am fed up with our idiotic government and all it represents. Many folks associate this view with Libertarianism. That is too narrow of a definition for me. But if you really want to know how I feel about these issues then I suggest you read [Declaration of Independents](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1586489380/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=nothoo-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=1586489380) by Matt Welch and Nick Gillepsie. I do not plan on blogging about these issues, unless they are directly related to software development.
